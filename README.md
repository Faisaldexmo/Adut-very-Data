The Adult Census Income Dataset is a widely used dataset in Machine Learning and Data Science. It is derived from the 1994 U.S. Census database and is mainly used for classification problems. The primary goal of this dataset is to predict whether a person’s annual income exceeds $50,000 or not based on demographic and employment-related attributes.
